# README: #
this is an old version of my Arduino-RealRobot interface developed on Delphi. It relies on a serial interface..this code is very old and is really just a test of github..enjoy!!

Now it is in MD mode....

I haven't compiled this code in later versions of Delphi (i.e. later than XE), so it may not work as expected...YMMV dt 21APR2019
